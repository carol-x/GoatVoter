# GoatVoter

Use GoatVoter and be a good voter! 

In DAO governance, we find a recurring issue of missing voting periods and high friction in seeking consensus within an organization. GoatVoter lets individual members cast their votes and casts the vote for the organization on the due date. No more high friction to collaborate with team members and no more votes missed when some members are engaged! 

We have the smart contract on Optimism as the backend for GoatVoter. The smart contract collects vote from the team and uses Hyperlane to trigger the vote function on the Ethereum chain. It supports governance voting on Uniswap, Makerdao, and Compound.
